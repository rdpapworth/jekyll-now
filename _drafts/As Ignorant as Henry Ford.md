title: As Ignorant as Henry Ford
---

I've just read about Henry Ford in Bill Bryson's excellent 'One Summer: America, 1927'. Hagiography it isn't. According to Bryson, Ford 'did not know much of anything' and his 'ignorance was a frequent source of wonder'. He supports his case with a number of examples which leave you in little doubt that Ford was something of a fool.

The problem is, without Google, I'd appear as big an idiot as Ford. While , I'm not sure that I'd be able to answer the questions that Ford fails to answer
