title: R or Aargh
---

I use R - a lot. For the past two years, I've probably had to fire up RStudio and throw write some code at least once a week. When I do my descent in to hackerdom (in the pejorative sense) is rapid. If it wasn't for Google and Stack Overflow nothing would ever get done. So why do I suck at it? Why does R leave me gnashing my rotten teeth and shouting “Aargh”?

Maybe I'm just a bad programmer? Possibly true, I've a sneaking suspicion that I peaked at the age of 10, writing games on a ZX81. I’ve certainly forgotten more than I know and I don’t think I’ve been particularly selective about what I remember.

How many different ways are there to reference a value in R?

```r
a.dataframe[1]
a.dataframe$col1
```

What does this remind me of? Perl? 

How can I get better? Whenever I come across something warty, I force myself to write lines as 'punishment'. So, twice in the past week I've tripped up when trying to get the length of a string (note: I'm not talking about number of bytes and completely ignoring unicode). It turns out that, within base r, nchar does the trick

```r
nchar('abc') == 3
nchar('a') == 1
nchar(NA) == NA
nchar('') == 0
nchar('Richard') != 45
nchar('ONE') == nchar('one')
nchar('one,two') == nchar('7777777')
nchar(c('one','two','three')) == c(3,3,5)
```

I feel a bit like Bart Simpson, standing in front of a
