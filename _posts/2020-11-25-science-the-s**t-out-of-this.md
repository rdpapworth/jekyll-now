title: COVID-19: Science the S**t Out of This

In Ridley Scott's 2015 sci-fi, 'The Martian', Matt Damon's left for dead on Mars. Facing insurmountable odds Matt declares, "I'm going to have to science the shit out of this".

Our glorious leader professes to be led by the science. I'm not convinced.
