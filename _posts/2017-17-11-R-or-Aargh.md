title: R or Aargh
---

I use R - a lot. For the past two years, I've probably had to fire up RStudio and throw write some code at least once a week. When I do my descent in to hackerdom (in the pejorative sense) is rapid. If it wasn't for Google and Stack Overflow nothing would ever get done. So why do I suck at it? Why does R leave me gnashing my rotten teeth and shouting “Aargh”?

Maybe I'm just a bad programmer? Possibly true, I've a sneaking suspicion that I peaked at the age of 10, writing games on a ZX81. I’ve certainly forgotten more than I know and I don’t think I’ve been particularly selective about what I remember.
